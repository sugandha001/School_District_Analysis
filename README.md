# School_District_Analysis
For this analysis we are assisting Maria, chief data scientist for a school district, analyze data on school grades 9. funding and student's standadized test scores for grades 9th, 10th,11th and 12th. These insights will be used for disussions and strategic decisions at school and district level.

### Prepared, inspected and cleaned up the data.
We cleaned up the data for any missing and duplicate values. There were about 1968 missing values in reading score and 982 missing values in math score. This may seem like a big number and it is but considering the size of the data we removed these values. When we averaged the scores for all schools it did not affect the analysis too much. We also dropped 1836 duplicate values to avoid skewed results.

### Result of the Analysis
The data needs to be analysed more for a conclusive analysis report. Factors like -
1) Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate.
2) The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school.
3) The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school.
4) School performance based on the budget per student.
5) School performance based on the school size.
